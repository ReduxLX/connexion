--- TopNavbar && BottomNavbar + Material UI ---
Problem: 
  Material UI components that displays pop ups will lock scrolling and set body tag overflow: auto
  as well as a padding-right to its contents (17px or equivalent). This auto-padding doesn't apply to 
  fixed components such as navbars which are fixed causing a shift to the right when opening mui popups.
Solution:
  Initialized a boolean variable, muiModalOpen, in App reducer which is toggled when any mui components
  pop-up is open/closed. Make both bottom/top navbars listen to the changes and set padding-right to 17px
  when any mui modal is opened. This ensures solves the shifting problem.

Problem:
  The issue is only occurring on desktop screens which means our solution above causes another problem
  on mobile devices as now we are moving the navbar left by 17px eventhough we don't need to.
Solution:
  Added function in utils to check if screen is mobile or desktop and modify both navbar logic to only
  apply the padding shift fix if: 1. Device is desktop && 2. muiModalOpen is true

--- Router's exclusive access ---
  To implement private routes, we create separate route components such as UnauthorizedRoute
  which is similar to a normal Route except with custom logic in it's render.
  For example, UnauthorizedRoute would redirect to "/" if user is signed in.
